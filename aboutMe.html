  <p>Hi! My names Jackson Dyer. I was born on a stormy January morning in New Hampshire, 20 years ago. Growing up my favorite toys were Lego's which is where I got a start at building things and learned  how fun it can be. As for fabrication expereince, I worked manufacturing for 4 years at my fathers manufacturing company, but I worked mostly in assembly, and drilling holes. I really do enjoy making things though, which I think is what brought me to this class. I get a lot of satification from solving problems, and making things so hopefully I have really high hopes for this class! </p>
